Hi, I am 657, a software developer from China. “657” is a homophone of my name in Chinese.

Sometimes I use “kuyermqi” as my username. “kuyermqi” is a coined word derived by applying a simple rail fence cipher to the pinyin of my Chinese name.

You can contact me by sending an email to [kuyermqi@outlook.com](mailto://kuyermqi@outlook.com).
